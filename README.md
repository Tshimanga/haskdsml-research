An exploration of the Haskell DS/ML Ecosystem


Haskell has always seemed a cool language.
It'd be rad to familiarize enough with the haskell ds/ml ecosystem to use and eventually contribute to it.
To that end, this project is an attempt to learn by doing.

Hopefully, if successful, this repo can eventually serve as a pedagogical reference for others exploring haskell as a data science tool.
